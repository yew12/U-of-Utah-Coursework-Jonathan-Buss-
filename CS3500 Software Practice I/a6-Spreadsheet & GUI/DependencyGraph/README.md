# Comments to Evaluators:

I decided not to change the "s" and "t" parameter names because they are interchangeable when it comes
to the dependents graph or the dependees graph. Dependents = (s=key, t=value); Dependees = (t=key, s=value);
Also, some of the comments may seem straightforward (if statements), I kept them there because it would help me 
step through the logic a little easier when writing the code. Just wanted to preface so it did not seem like I had 
this idea you guys would not understand. 

# Assignment Specific Topics

As far as this assignment, I tried to reference a lot of the places that I did my research. I did not have any questions
in regards to certain syntax, rather trying to understand the data structures I was using and how I could utilize them. That is 
why I put down all the locations I did my research. 

# Consulted Peers:

I was very active on piazza so try and have some questions answered as well as trying to asnwer some questions for other
students. As far as other people I consulted, they included various TA's to try and understand concepts/methods better. 
I also talked to someone in my lab about my testing file not working. It had to do with the naming of the namespace for the 
testing project.
