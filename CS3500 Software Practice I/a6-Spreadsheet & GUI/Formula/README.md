# Comments to Evaluators:

No comments for right now. 

# Assignment Specific Topics

The only thing I am concerned about is in my ToString() method where I round the integers. I assume this takes care of floating
point numbers (which it does in my tests) but I am unsure if this is the correct way to go about it. 

# Consulted Peers:

Talked to a lot of the TAs throughout the week for help and they helped a lot throughout the assignment. Also discussed the assignment with one
of my lab partners named Ryann (don't know his last name). I also looked at piazza from time to time for guidance in some areas.
