	2. Navigation around cells w/:

	3. Number of spreadsheets open tracker
		- In the top right of the spreadsheet GUI you will notice 
		a text box keeping track of the number of spreadsheets 
		the user currently has open.

	4. Enter key
		- Everytime you press the enter key, you set the cell contents. 
		Meaning if you had typed in a formula, when you press enter that cell
		will be calculated. 
		
		Works the same as the set cell contents button. 

	5. FormulaError feedback
		- If the user enters a formula that results in a FormulaError (9/0),
		then an "#INVALID" string will appear in that given cell space.
