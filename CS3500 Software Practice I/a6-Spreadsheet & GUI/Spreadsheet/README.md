# Comments to Evaluators:

I never used <inheritdoc> as I already inherited the AbstractSpreadsheet class another way through Microsoft docs. 
I think I also mention this mostly every week but I may over comment my work, but I do it to help me walk through
my code as I am writing it. I just want to preface that so it doesn't look like I am assuming you would not understand
what is going on. 

This block stands true for assignment 5.

# Assignment Specific Topics

Nothing I want to address here other than I thought this assignment was fairly straight forward as far as writing the code
once I was able to understand what was going on and what needed to happen. Most of my time was trying to understand
the assignment documentation because it specified that if we were to understand it correctly, we would only write 
minimal amount of code. So that was my approach as I tried to utilize the code I had already written as much as possible. 

This still holds true with everything that doesn't regard XML reading/writing. 

# Consulted Peers:

Consulted members in lab about the assignment and their approach. Also consulted several TA's throughout the week 
as I usually do. I also talked with some people I met in the CADE lab for ideas on how to approach different methods.
