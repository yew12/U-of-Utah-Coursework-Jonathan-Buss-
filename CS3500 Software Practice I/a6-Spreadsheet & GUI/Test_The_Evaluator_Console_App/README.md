# Comments to Evaluators:

Work stands on its own. 

# Assignment Specific Topics
A
I have no additional feedback to add. This test file is used for testing my FormulaEvaluator project and
more specifically my Evaluator class library. I created testing methods that should clearly explain what
the tests were doing while also adding comments to aide the explanations. 

# Consulted Peers:

I did not consult any peers for this test project. Only the TA's for some questions.
