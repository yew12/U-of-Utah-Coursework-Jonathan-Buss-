# Comments to Evaluators:

We created one non-API specific method which needed to be 
accessed outside the Networking class called isConnectedCheck. We figured this was a useful method
for essentially checking if the client had a connection established and would then return true or false.
We worked on making the Networking class as 'generic' as possible to be able to utilized in a variety of
different functionalities in the future.

# Assignment Specific Topics

One issue we ran across was working with multiple threads and when/how to create a new thread. Understanding
how an asynchronous method works took a little time too.

# Consulted Peers: 

Consulted several TA's and other members in the CADE lab that are in the same class about how they 
approached the assignment.
