# Overview of the our Chat Program

In this solution, my partner and I have created a chatting program that allows the user of this code the ability to 
host a server or boot up a chat client, to connect to a server, or both. All this is done through a networking API that essentially
builds that connection to allow communication between the client and the server

In the chat client, the user is able to connect to a running server either through an IP address or by the server's name. 
Once connected, the user is given the ability to send messages, see other people's messages, retrieve the server's current participants 
and connect/disconnect from server. 

As for running the server side, the user is able to start/shutdown server with a click of a button. They are also able to see
who has connected/disconnected and who are the current participants. Lastly, they can see the list of messages from each of the clients
who are currently in the server, as well as any old messages that were sent during that given time the server has been running.
